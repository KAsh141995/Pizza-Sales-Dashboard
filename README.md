# Pizza Sales Insights #
PowerBI dashboard showcasing one year of comprehensive pizza sales data, including key attributes like pizza size and category. Uncover insights on the best-selling pizza, preferred pizza sizes, and track daily/monthly sales trends. The dashboard incorporates DAX functions for KPIs and Power Query for dynamic chart visuals.

In Power BI, I incorporated slicers and navigation buttons for enhanced interactivity. Employed DAX functions to formulate key performance indicators (KPIs) and leveraged Power Query to generate more meaningful charts
